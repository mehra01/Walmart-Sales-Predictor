## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Walmart Sales Dataset  
- **Features include:**
  - Store type and size  
  - Weekly sales records  
  - Additional economic and holiday-related features  

- **Target Variable:** `Weekly_Sales`

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Merged multiple raw datasets into a unified dataset.  
- Encoded categorical columns.  
- Applied scaling and handled missing values.  
- Split dataset into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  

---

## 🚀 Model
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  

**Performance Metrics:**
- **RMSE (Train):** 2276.94  
- **RMSE (Validation):** 5645.86  
- **RMSE (Test):** 5363.81  

---

## 📈 Results
- The model demonstrates strong predictive capability on unseen data.  
- Provides insights into the impact of store type, seasonality, and holidays on weekly sales.
